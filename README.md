In this project-based, highly engaging course by Maven Analytics, I took on the role
of a business owner who recently acquired Maven Movies, a brick-and-mortar DVD
rental shop. Using MySQL and MySQL Workbench, I analyzed the business's database
to uncover key insights about inventory, staff performance, and customer behavior.
This hands-on experience allowed me to develop practical SQL skills to extract, join,
and interpret data, enabling data-driven decision-making for the business.

At the end of the course, I applied these skills in the final project, which I am
presenting here. The project involved addressing key questions from a potential
acquirer of Maven Movies by analyzing various aspects of the business using SQL.
